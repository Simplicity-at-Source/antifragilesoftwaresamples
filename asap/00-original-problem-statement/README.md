# Actionable Sentiment Analysis Processor Original Problem Description

## The problem

Chatter creates a large amount of conversation amongst Sky People. As Chatter grows in popularity it is increasingly difficult for the correct people to respond to conversations in a timely fashion which means that the conversations can escalate when there is no need. The problem is exacerbated by the number of posts that need to be analysed on a daily basis, and the difficulty in identifying where the posts are happening (e.g. groups, on individual walls etc.)
 
# The need

There is a need to easily identify and view conversations that are ‘trending’ (i.e. have a number of contributors in a short amount of time, and are actively creating discussion) in real time and associate some sentiment to those conversations. The Chatter team and management within the contact centres will then be able to use this information to respond to conversations in chatter in a timely fashion.
